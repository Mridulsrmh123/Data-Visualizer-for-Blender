This is an experimental python script for Blender that can be used to visualized "dual-column" based datasets, and read that in a .csv format, and creates a "ball-stick" 3D model. This code is still in development so use cases are restricted from full production. Using geometry nodes in Blender the functionality of the 3D model can be highly extended to create motion graphics and other form of immersive experiences. We request for others with an expertise in this field to contribute to the code to make a full fledged experience. Our goal is to create a realtime motion graphics experience from datasets available online or datasets provided by the user.
